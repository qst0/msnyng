Back to the blog again. Cerealize.me is down-- the domain expired.

What now?

I guess learn more on how to consistantly update this.

Make it really easy.

Do I really need the YYY-MM-DD in front of a post? Ughh.

This is cool for sure!

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hello(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}"
end
print_hi('World')
#=> prints 'Hello, World' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I'll be sure to check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If I have questions, I can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
